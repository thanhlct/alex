          You are given a task which will require you to <strong>call an automated phone service and request information</strong> about a public transport <i>connection from one place to another</i>, about the <i>number of transfers</i>, <i>next connection</i>, <i>time of departure</i>, <i>weather across the US</i>, <i>what is the time</i>, etc.
          </p>
          <p>You can say <i>"Help"</i> for hints on how to use the service. If the system seems confused, you can say <i>"Reset"</i> or <i>"Start over"</i> to start over. The service can pick up what you are saying and ask you questions as the dialogue goes along.
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Make sure you are in a quiet place and turn off disturbing elements such as TV for the system may pick up sources of noise and understand you poorly.</li>
              <li>After you are connected, please try to talk naturally about the topic presented in the green box at the bottom.</li>
              <li>Talk in whole sentences, don't say just key words.</li>
              <li>The call is finished by saying <span style="color: red;">"Thank you, Goodbye"</span> to the system.</li>
              <li>At the end of the call, the <strong>system will give you a four-digit code</strong> which you have to enter into a field down below, once the call is terminated. This is used to verify the authenticity of Job submissions.</li>
              <li>You will not be given any code if you do not exchange at least three sentences with the system, so do not rush the dialogue towards the end too quickly. Just chat a little.</li>
              <li>If a correct code is entered, you can fill in a short feedback form.</li> 
              <li>Your code will only be valid for 15 minutes, so be sure to fill in the form right after you finish the call.</li>
              <li>You are more than welcome to enter general comments and observations.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The feedback is very important as only the calls with the correct code and completed feedback will be accepted.</p>
